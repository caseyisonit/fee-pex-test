# CinéSeek

I have built a single page app that digests movie data through an axios call in the Vuex store. There is an ability to search by movie title, actor name or genre. Alternatively you can filter by genre in the drop down. To add a unique visual identifier to each movie, I have added a random color to each one that is used for the card background.

### Features I would like to add:
- Ability to search and filter simultaneously
  - Currently it's either/or
- Filter by more criteria (i.e. series, date)
- More data included in the response to add more valuable content to the user. 
  - With that data we could include movie poster in the card and have a hover or modal that includes the synopsis and the rest of the details
